<div class="explain">
<!--
<p class="explain_p">Please remember that this music for live instruments is largely a 
pieces of impersonation or perhaps mockery even.
A brief explanation of the music is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>For the common 18th century European ensemble of 2 violins, viola, and cello, &#171;&auml;lter krimskrams&#187;</dt> 
<dd>a funny odd little piece utilizing &#8220;styles&#8221; from different sorts of musics, i.e. characteristics thereof. e.g.
cascading cadential figures &#224; la late 17th and early 18th European music, music of the &#8220;Asian Continent&#8221; ahem, 
Celtic folkmusics, and so on</dd>
<dt>For the ensemble of piano, vibraphone, and harpsichord, &#171;Walking in fresh air&#187;</dt>
<dd>
in this tune one concerns oneself with a walk in early morning while it slowly changes
</dd>
<dt>For voice and piano, an air upon the sonnet of Mr. Spenser: &#171;was is the work of nature or of art?&#187;
<dd>this air is set in a fashion reflecting the style of mid-20th century popular American music
</dd>
