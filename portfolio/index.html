						<p>This small web application was designed and the front-end developed as part of a client facing marketing tech service.
							The mission of this portion of the overall applicaton was to collect soft data to build in-depth client profiles.
							Additionally, at this juncture the clients would provide links to any datasets they have access to share to help train
							the picture/output of the overall application to best reflect the client's position in the market.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<p>The atmosphere was intended to feel warm while still giving the client references to 'high tech' interface components.</p>
						</p>
						<img src="../images/qonb1.jpg" />
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>While soft data is collected to foster better communication (client/account manager relationship) and feature enhancements,
							this application also collects the expect demographics, as these are useful in the context of the applicaition's place
							in the greater application.
							<br/>
							<br/> This part of the service is the first step in a process that allows the greater application to begin "learning" about
							the client.

					<p>In the spring of 2010, work began re-designing the website for the Library System of East Baton Rouge Parish. For years,
						content providers had been adding content without much focus on content strategy or IA. The structure of the site at
						large was not directed toward defined goals or clearly calling the public to the information they needed at the point
						of use.
					</p>
					<p>First steps were to determine the most important content for the mission and strategy of the organization. Library administration
						and staff were consulted to get their expert opinions of what they and the public needed to have easy access to first
						and foremost. This was no small task, as a library's mission is serve everyone with everything they could possibly
						need information-wise.
					</p>
					<div class="contain-img">
						<img src="../images/ebrplhp.png" alt="EBRPL Homepage">
						<img src="../images/ebrplo.png" alt="EBRPL Outreach">
					</div>
					<p>
						Once we had a solid idea of the new strategy for the site, I began designing site and module concepts for testing. The feedback
						received from the library staff and the public was invaluable in moving forward with the designs and planning. After
						this research was gathered, the most important features/functions that stood out for the local community were determined
						as: (1) Access to search library resources; (2) Locations &amp; Hours; (3) Renewing Books; (4) Access to the Library
						Board's Activities.

					</div>
					<p>
						In the summer of 2010, at the end of the research and early design phases, coding and staging began with a launch date of
						December 23. Though a full re-design of site content and structure was in the works, with specs and requirements changing
						here and there, the Christmas goal was indeed met - launching before the expected date.
					</p>

					<p>
						The past three years have, of course, seen a fair number of iterations and additions: various mini-sites for events and programs,
						a mobile site for easy access to digital resources (early Spring 2011), refinement of site navigation, regular content
						audits, redesign of access to digital resources and databases, as well constant improvements to site appearance and
						functionality.

						For my part, the scope of this project was to develop a mobile-first framework for a community resource &amp; data mapping
						site as part of a city-wide initiative, "Better Baton Rouge." I was responsible for the logo design/graphics, UI/UX,
						framework HTML, CSS, jQuery, and some basic PHP. During this project, I gained experience using basic PHP, some Angular.js,
						and Git.
					</p>
					<img src="../images/ckm_b.png">
					<p>
						The basic push of this website was initially to map community resources, census data, and community statistics. Eventually,
						through various meetings and discussions, it was decided that events and magazine portions should to be added. The
						idea was to draw in more of the sections of the population who might not otherwise have a need for community maps and
						statistics at first glance.
					</p>

					<p>
						The current phase of the project has included two back-end developers and a number of GIS engineers and specialists who are
						working on the events, magazine, and mapping modules.
